# Site Maintainence Guide
## Overview
This document contains information for those maintaining or changing the website through the use of Wordpress. It will cover the plugins currently being used for some of the websites features as well as the pages 
and their content such as posts. The document will also provide some insight and advice on any future changes that may be made to site as well.

## Adding New Content
##### What Are Pages?
A brief overview of what the pages are, we have the Home page, About Us, Contact, and others. These can be identified in the Navigation bar at the top of the page. Each page is primarily used for static content and
can be arranged in any order you would like.

### Adding Pages
To begin adding a new page:
* Navigate to the Wordpress dashboard
* Click on "Pages" in the sidebar menu
* Click "Add New"
* Enter the Title and Content of your new page
* If you are creating a sub-page, make sure you assign a parent page
* Click "Publish" when you are ready to make it live

##### What Are Posts?
The purpose of posts is to create dynamic content like news updates, blogs, or events. They can be arranged by date or alphabetically and can be assigned categories and tags to make navigation easier. You can see an example of these on the "Links" page.

### Adding Posts
To begin adding a new post:
* Navigate to the Wordpress dashboard
* Click on "Posts" in the sidebar menu
* Click "Add New"
* Enter the title and content of your new post
* Assign categories and tags to organize your post
* Click "Publish" when you are ready to make it live

## Catergories and Tags
**Categories** help organise your posts into different topics or sections. Choosing the category most relevant to your post will be most effective as it will help your audience find what they may be looking for.
If you feel that a post may match more than one category, then you may assign more than one category. If you think that a post may not be relevant to any current categories, then feel free to create a new
category. You will notice that the categories have been used for all the links on the links page. If you wish to create a new category then follow the steps below:
* Navigate to the Wordpress dahboard
* Click on "Posts" in the sidebar menu
* In the sidebar menu you will see more options under "Posts"
* Click on "Categories" in the "Posts" submenu
* Give your new category a name
* Assign your category a parent category if it needs one
* Once finished, click "Add New Category"

**Tags** are more specific keywords related to the content of your post. Use them to make your content more searchable and accessible. You may notice that no tags have been created for use on the website as we
have found no use for them currently and categories do a great job in organising content. If you wish to add tags follow the instructions below:
* Navigate to the Wordpress dashboard
* Click on "Posts" in the sidebar menu
* In the sidebar menu you will see more options under "Posts"
* Click on "Tags" in the "Posts" submenu
* Give your new tag a name
* Once finished, click "Add New Tag"

plugins follow the steps below:
